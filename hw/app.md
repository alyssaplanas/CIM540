# awesome app
My idea of a perfect app is pretty silly but something I wish has existed for a while now. It takes after the idea of IMDB but has to do with songs. I always hear a song and i’m like “oh gosh what movie is that from?” and I can never figure it out! The set up would be that you can look up a song and it would tell you all the movies that song has been in and it would show the scenes as well. It would also work vice versa, if you can’t remember the song from a movie you’re thinking of you can look up the movie and it would have all the songs that appeared with a short video of the scene with the song attached. I can’t even say how many times this app would have saved me from many hours of googling and searching just trying to figure out one song.
