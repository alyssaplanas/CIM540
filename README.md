## Alyssa Planas

I am a student at the University of Miami majoring in Public Relations. I also have a double minor in Interactive Media and Music Business.

My campus involvement includes being a part of greek life with the Zeta Tau Alpha organization. I am also the president of Hurricane Production Concerts.

My passion is music and I hope to one day work in the music business industry. I am planning to be out in Los Angeles this upcoming summer.
